Feel free to contribute!

Abstract:
In the past, photo albums acted as gateways into our past. Today, phones and tablets can capture and hold those cherished memories; except most of the images come from a single device. EventShowcase is a mobile application for Android that strives to fill the void in digitally crowd-sourcing photography at physical events. Hosts can create location and date specific events, invite guests, and contribute images within the application. App users in the vicinity of an event can take and upload photos to a central server and vote on their favorite images from other participants. After the event ends, the top images are shared in a slideshow to preserve the most captivating depiction of the occasion. The project was developed using Eclipse with Android Development Tools and tested on a Nexus 10 tablet.
